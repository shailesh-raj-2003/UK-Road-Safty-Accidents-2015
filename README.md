# UK Road Safety Accidents 2015

## Overview

This project analyzes road safety accidents in the UK for the year 2015. It aims to provide insights into the patterns and causes of road accidents, helping to enhance safety measures and inform policy decisions.

## Features

- Data exploration and cleaning
- Visualization of accident data
- Statistical analysis of factors contributing to accidents
- Machine learning models for accident prediction

## Data Sources

The data for this project is sourced from the UK Department for Transport and includes detailed records of road accidents across the country in 2015.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shailesh-raj-2003/UK-Road-Safty-Accidents-2015.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd UK-Road-Safty-Accidents-2015
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To start the analysis, run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can also explore the Jupyter notebooks for detailed step-by-step analysis.

## Analysis

This project includes various analyses such as:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data distribution and trends.
- **Visualization**: Creating plots to visualize accident hotspots and trends over time.
- **Machine Learning**: Building models to predict the likelihood of accidents based on various factors.

## Results

Key findings from the analysis include:

- Identification of high-risk areas for road accidents.
- Correlation between weather conditions and accident frequency.
- Insights into demographics most affected by road accidents.
